            <h2>Blue Dragon</h2>
            <p>Heading to the ocean, the blue dragon (Glaucus Atlanticus) is one tough fish. It can eat larger venomous
                prey animals, and it keeps its stingers as weapons to use against its own predators (talk about taking
                trophies).</p>

            <h2>Axolotl</h2>
            <p>The axolotl is a truly amazing creature that's amphibian and a salamander. I find the axolotl a very
                colorful and cute creature with the body of a late-stage tadpole with sensors that scan the deepest
                waters for predators and prey. Like most amphibians, the axolotl lives a decade, and it is able to
                regenerate limbs, such as their legs, and it can even recover from brain damage.</p>

            <h2>Owls</h2>
            <p>Owls may look so funny that you'd believe them to be a hoot. When they need a closer look at something
                they are interested in, an owl can twist its neck around 270 degrees. This means they can see behind
                them and even around to the front, eliminating blind spots.</p>
